Pakistan is divided administratively into four provinces, the Federal Capital Region, and two autonomous regions, in addition to the federally administered tribal areas. 
The eight federal states and regions of Pakistan are divided into smaller administrative units, which are the people, and the people, in turn, are divided into smaller administrative units, which are the collections, and each collection, in turn, is divided into several federal councils.
The population of Pakistan was 213,222,917 million according to the final results of the 2017 census in Pakistan.  Pakistan is the fifth most populous country in the world.  Pakistan's population increased more than sixfold between 1951 and 2017, increasing from 33.7 million to 207.7 million.  The country has a relatively high, though low, growth rate, supported by high birth rates and low death rates.  The average annual population growth rate was +2.40% between 1998 and 2017.  Therefore, it is difficult to find homes available for rent or for sale easily or at low prices
The goal is to predict rental or house price for sale with minimum

In this project I relied on the Pakistan house price prediction Dataset
